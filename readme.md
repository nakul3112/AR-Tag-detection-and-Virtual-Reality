## This project is the part of a course-Perception of Autonomous Robots.

It has the application of homography and warp perspective transformations for superimposing the image(Lena.jpg) onto the AR tag in given image sequence, and then use 3D coordinates of cube mapped to the AR tag on 2D image, to produce a virtual reality application.

The codes are as follows:
1) Proj_1_Cube.py
2) Proj_1_Lena.py

The corresponding output videos can be found as:
1) lena-superimpose.avi
2) virtual-cube.avi
